# QuizBot

A bot for the Literati 2020-21 Discord server that coordinates Online Quizzing related functionalities such as pouncing, scorekeeping, etc.

The main JavaScript for the bot is the file `bot.js`. The commands are stored in the `commands` folder.

**I might include additional functionalities in the future for Writers/Readers/Word Game meets as well.
